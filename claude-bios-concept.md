# Claude BIOS: AI at the Kernel Level

## Concept Overview

A "Claude BIOS" would represent a fundamental shift in computing architecture - integrating AI capabilities directly into the system's firmware/BIOS layer, before the operating system even loads.

## Current BIOS/UEFI Architecture

Traditional BIOS/UEFI serves as:
- Hardware initialization layer
- Boot device selection
- Basic hardware configuration
- Hand-off to operating system bootloader

## Claude BIOS Vision

   - Hardware-accelerated via TPM/secure enclave

2. **Intelligent Boot Manager**
   - Predictive boot optimization
   - Self-healing boot sequences
   - Adaptive hardware configuration

3. **System Health Monitor**
   - Pre-OS diagnostics with AI analysis
   - Predictive failure detection
   - Automated recovery procedures
