# Llamux Roadmap 🦙🚀

## Phase 1: Core Functionality ✅ COMPLETED!
- [x] Basic kernel module structure
- [x] GGUF parser implementation  
- [x] GGML kernel implementation
- [x] Real model loading (TinyLlama)
- [x] Memory management fixes
- [x] Proc filesystem interface

## Phase 2: Real Inference 🔥 CURRENT
- [ ] Implement actual inference instead of mock responses
- [ ] Add proper tokenization (BPE/SentencePiece)
- [ ] Implement quantized operations (Q4_K)
- [ ] Add streaming token generation
- [ ] Performance optimization for kernel context

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features 🚀
- [ ] Character device (`/dev/llama`) for better API
- [ ] Multiple concurrent inference sessions
- [ ] Model hot-swapping without module reload
- [ ] Support for larger models (Llama 2 7B, 13B)
- [ ] GPU acceleration hooks (for future)

## Phase 4: System Integration 🔧
- [ ] Kernel command completion (AI-powered tab complete)
- [ ] Smart error messages with AI explanations
- [ ] `/proc/ai/*` - AI-enhanced proc entries
- [ ] Integration with kernel logging (AI log analysis)
- [ ] Smart OOM killer decisions

## Phase 5: Advanced Models 🧠
- [ ] Support for Llama 2 70B (with memory reservation)
- [ ] Support for Mixtral/MoE models
- [ ] Dynamic model loading based on available memory
- [ ] Model quantization on-the-fly
- [ ] Multi-model support (different models for different tasks)

## Phase 6: Production Ready 🏭
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Security audit (no model injection)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Debian/Ubuntu package (.deb)
- [ ] Automated testing framework

## Experimental Ideas 💡
- [ ] AI-powered kernel debugging
- [ ] Smart scheduling based on workload prediction
- [ ] Predictive I/O optimization
- [ ] Natural language kernel configuration
- [ ] Voice-controlled kernel (with userspace helper)

## Hardware Support Goals 🖥️
- [ ] x86_64 ✅ (current)
- [ ] ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon)
- [ ] RISC-V (for the future!)
- [ ] GPU offloading (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
- [ ] NPU/TPU support

## Model Support Goals 📊
Current:
