## The Dream

Imagine booting your computer and seeing:
```
[    0.123456] ðŸ¦™ Llamux: Good morning! I noticed you usually start Chrome first.
[    0.234567] ðŸ¦™ Llamux: Pre-loading frequently accessed files...
[    0.345678] ðŸ¦™ Llamux: System optimized for your workday. Have a great one!
```

Then later:
```
$ llama "my computer feels slow"
ðŸ¦™ Firefox has 847 tabs open (again). Want me to hibernate the ones you haven't touched in a week?

$ llama "yes please, and optimize for coding"
ðŸ¦™ Done! Also noticed you're low on RAM. I've preemptively compressed some caches and adjusted scheduler for IDE priority. Happy coding!
```

## This is Just the Beginning

We've proven it's possible. We have working code. We have a clear path.

Now we build the future where your OS doesn't just run programs - it understands them.

**Llamux: The OS that thinks.** ðŸ¦™ðŸ§ ðŸš€
